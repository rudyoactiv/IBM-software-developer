# Book Review Backend Application

Contained within this repository is a Server-side Application for Book Reviews, developed as a component of IBM's course on Building Backend Applications with Node.js and Express.

### Course Overview
Title: Building Backend Applications with Node.js and Express

Project Type: Final Assignment

Course Provider: IBM

### Technologies Employed

This project utilizes the Express framework to seamlessly implement CRUD functionalities through HTTP methods, thoroughly tested using Postman. Prioritizing security, Session and JWT authentication mechanisms are integrated to restrict specific operations exclusively to authenticated users. The codebase is optimized by employing Promises, Callbacks, or Async/Await functions, enabling concurrent interactions by multiple users without interdependence on each other's actions.

### Key Functions

- Retrieve a comprehensive list of available books in the bookstore.
- Search for specific books and fetch their details based on ISBN codes, author names, and titles.
- Fetch reviews/comments for designated books.
- Register as a new user within the application.
- Log in to the application securely.
- Add a new review for a book (restricted to logged-in users).
- Edit a book review (users can only modify their own reviews).
- Delete a book review (users can only delete their own reviews).
- (Multi-user capability) Concurrently access the application to view and manage distinct book reviews.
